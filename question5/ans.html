<p>The z-index property in CSS determines the stacking order of elements on a webpage.
    <br>
</p><h4>
    Elements with a higher z-index value are displayed on top of elements with a lower value.
    It's like a stack of papers: the higher the paper in the stack
    (higher z-index), the more visible it is.
